  <!-- Fungoid ship part -->

  <VRE_FungoidShipPart.label>частина корабля (гриболюди)</VRE_FungoidShipPart.label>
  <VRE_FungoidShipPart.description>An ancient ship part, torn off of an old space exploration craft, mostly destroyed on reentry. It might be thousands of years old.\n\nThis one may contain one or more of the remaining space crew. Governments used to send out crafts filled with immortal fungoids, wicked, twisted experimental xenotypes that can survive the centuries-long space journeys. The fungoids onboard have most likely lost their sense of self long ago. They must have been stuck in this space craft module for hundreds of years.</VRE_FungoidShipPart.description>
